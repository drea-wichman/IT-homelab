# IT Home Lab Setup

## Overview
Building a home lab environment to gain hands-on experience with IT fundamentals

## My Goals
- Work with Windows Server and Active Directory(!!!)
- Practice hardware troubleshooting and component installation
- Configure network settings and connectivity
- Manage multiple OS and virtual machines
- Simulate IT support scenarios
